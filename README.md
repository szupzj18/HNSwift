# HNSwift Client


</div>

A hacker news client by Chris.

Fully written in Swift UI.

you can now [install beta test](https://testflight.apple.com/join/6WBYaKWs).

## Feature

- pull the latest top 10 HackerNews posts.
- pull the latest top 10 HN show posts.
- reader mode (backed by safari reader)
- [wip] iPad split mode.
- [futrue] random.

> Why we don't have "loadmore"? Because I don't want to doom scrolling and end up spending too much time in HackerNews (as I used to).
